Problem Statement 
The Asia Cup is a prestigious cricket tournament currently will get organised soon. 
There is a need for a comprehensive and insightful data analysis report to be created using 
Power BI that can serve as a historical archive and a real-time performance tracker.

The core objectives of this project are:
 - To create a visually appealing and easy-to-navigate Power BI dashboard that presents 
historical Asia Cup match data.
 - To identify and visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total wins, 
most successful teams, and top individual records.
 - To establish and visualize correlations between different variables 
(e.g., batting first vs. winning, home advantage, etc.) and provide clear, concise inferences from the data.
 - To dedicate a separate, detailed section or "story" specifically for the India vs. Pakistan 
rivalry, providing a head-to-head analysis of their matches.
 - To ensure the entire project is documented and structured professionally, 
following best practices for a GitHub repository submission.
